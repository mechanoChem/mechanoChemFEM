/**
 * @page examples Examples
 * 
 * The following is a list of example initial boundary value problems and their documentation. Example 1 serves as a introductary problem of mechano-chemical coupling exmaple built based on dealMultiphysics library.
 * The other examples come from the various research code int the Computational Physics Group. Example 2 includes an extra object of the <a href="https://www.dealii.org/8.5.0/doxygen/deal.II/classDoFHandler.html">dof_handler</a>  class to hold extra nodal data. Example 3 includes \link computedField<dim> computedField \endlink class for post processing.
 * Example 3 includes interface conditions and applys constraints during the solve step. 

The code for all examples can be found at <a href="https://github.com/mechanoChem/mechanoChemFEM/tree/example"><B>Github</B></a>.
