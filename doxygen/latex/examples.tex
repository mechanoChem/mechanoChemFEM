The following is a list of example initial boundary value problems and their documentation. Example 1 serves as a introductory example of mechano-\/chemical coupling built on mechano\-Chem\-F\-E\-M lib. The other examples come from the various research code int the Computational Physics Group. Example 2 includes an extra object of the \href{https://www.dealii.org/8.5.0/doxygen/deal.II/classDoFHandler.html}{\tt dof\-\_\-handler} class to hold extra nodal data. Example 3 includes \hyperlink{}{computed\-Field } class for post processing. Example 3 includes interface conditions and applys constraints during the solve step.

The code for all examples can be found at \href{https://github.com/mechanoChem/mechanoChemFEM/tree/example}{\tt {\bfseries Github}}.
